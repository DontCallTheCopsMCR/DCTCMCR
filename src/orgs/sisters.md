Sisters Uncut is a British feminist direct action group that is opposed to cuts to UK government services for domestic violence victims.[1] It was founded in November 2014, and came to international prominence in October 2015 for a protest on the red carpet at the London premiere of the film Suffragette.[2] The group identify as intersectional feminists, and is open to women (including trans and intersex women), nonbinary, agender and gender variant people.[3] The group aims to organise non-hierarchically and uses consensus decision-making.[3] Sisters Uncut originated in London but has regional groups throughout the UK[4] including Manchester and Leeds.[5]
