Crisis line connecting callers with trained counselors to discuss and address any personal issues they are experiencing, from thoughts of suicide to food insecurity to loneliness. Referrals for services like support groups and counseling, and assistance with basic needs, such as food and shelter, are available. Counselors are trained to work with callers to identify any additional services that may be required. In the case that in-person intervention is needed they will contact emergency services â€“ caller will be informed that this is occurring.
