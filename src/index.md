The police do not solve the problems we face in our communities. 

This website is an online directory of local resources available in Manchester that you can use instead of calling the police. It is part utility, part stimulus for thinking about what local abolition looks like. It is not a perfect resource but our goal is to seed the idea that a different, better future is possible - one where well resourced and funded community services enable us to live in a world without police.

We are abolitionists and we believe that a better future is possible. Abolition in our lifetime requires patience, work, and imagination. We also want to explore the ideas and evidence that supports this work.
