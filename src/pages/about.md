This is an online directory of local resources available in Manchester that you can use instead of calling the police. 

It is not a perfect resource but our goal is to seed the idea that a different, better future is possible - one where well resourced and funded community services enable us to live in a world without police. 

The police do not solve the problems we face in our communities. It is not their job to solve the problems. 

The police punish people who commit “crime”, without asking why “crime” is happening. If we do not work out the root causes of a problem and address them then the problem will happen again and again. Communities are not made safer or stronger by this system, or by the police, and we must create new ways to deal with harm in our society. This belief is called “abolition” - a term which is explained more below. 

What’s more, the police force is deeply and structurally racist, homophobic, transphobic and misogynistic. It has a violent past and present. This affects who is under surveillance, who is listened to, and who is punished or protected by the state.

Despite these issues, we can often feel like calling the police is the only option we have. This site exists to connect you to alternative emergency and crisis resources available in Manchester, so we can start to approach our city’s problems in a better way. 

This site also links to supportive resources for communities facing more police hostility and surveillance.

**Accountability**

We have done our best to ask our networks to comment and contribute to this list. Many of these organisations have a legal responsibility to engage with police at varying levels and we have made that clear where we are aware of it, but please take care. 

**We recognise that people may have had negative experiences with some of these organisations and we want to hear from you. We will aim to update this site as often as we can. Please email [sistersuncutmcr@gmail.com](mailto:sistersuncutmcr@gmail.com), but know that it may take us a while to get back to you as we’re just a few organisers volunteering our time.**
