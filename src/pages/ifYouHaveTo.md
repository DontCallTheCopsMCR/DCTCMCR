**When might you need to call the cops?** 

You may be in a situation where you feel you need to call the police - for example, when a violent crime is happening in front of you and people are at risk. 

Sometimes your insurance company may require you to report a crime and get a crime number to make a claim. This does not mean you have to support a prosecution later. 

How should you deal with the police when they arrive?

How can you protect the people around you? 

If someone is arrested by the police, make sure they know their rights. You can carry “bust cards” to give out - for example: <https://www.release.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/publications/Release%20Bust%20Card%202013.pdf>.
