**Find alternatives to calling the Greater Manchester Police**

This site exists to connect you to alternative resources available in Manchester, so we can start to approach our city’s problems in a better way. This site also links to supportive resources for communities facing more police hostility and surveillance. 

We have done our best to vet these resources, by asking the organisations and our networks to comment on how closely these organisations work with the police. We learned that many of these organisations have a legal responsibility to engage with police at varying levels and we have made that clear where we are aware of it, but please take care. 

If you or any of your friends have had negative experiences of any organisations listed, please email [sistersuncutmcr@gmail.com](mailto:sistersuncutmcr@gmail.com). We aim to update this site as often as we can but please be aware that it may take us a while to act on your reviews.
