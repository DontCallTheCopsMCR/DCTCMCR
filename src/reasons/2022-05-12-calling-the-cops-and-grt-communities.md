title: Calling the cops and GRT Communities
---
The Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller way of life is under attack in the UK.

 Since the 1980s, two thirds of traditional stopping sites for Gypsies, Roma and Travellers (GRT), some which had been in use for thousands of years, have been sealed off (1). In 1994, the duty of local authorities to provide official sites for travelling people was repealed (2). In 2021, there were 1700 GRT households on waiting lists for pitches and only 59 pitches available nationwide (3). There is just one “authorised” site in Manchester, and in 2014 it was deemed not fit for purpose due to the need for repairs and risk of flooding. 

 The lack of safe authorised sites means that Gypsies, Roma and Travellers are forced to stop at unauthorised sites which don’t have the facilities they need. Local people near these sites are often extremely hostile towards GRT people and often call the police.

The GRT community experiences a huge amount of prejudice, including prejudice from the police. Almost three quarters of police officers believe Gypsy and Traveller people are prone to crime because of their ethnicity and three quarters of police officers have shown unconscious bias and/or racist behaviour towards GRT people (4).

These factors mean that Gypsies, Roma and Travellers are over policed and under-resourced, and recent legislation is going to make it even worse (5). But we can refuse to go along with this. GRT people need and deserve more pitches, more resources, and more welcome from the communities – and fewer police in their lives. Put pressure on local Government (and your neighbours) to do the right thing.
