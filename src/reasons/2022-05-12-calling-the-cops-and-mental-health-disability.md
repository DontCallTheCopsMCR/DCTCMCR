title: "Calling the cops and mental health & disability "

The police are not mental health practitioners and cannot be trusted to care for people in a mental health crisis. All too often, behaviours that result from a mental health crisis are used as an excuse to criminalise and incarcerate the person in crisis. People in crisis are often put in police cells - often a deeply traumatising and distressing experience - and there is no guarantee that the police officers interacting with them will have had any specialist mental health training.
