title: "Calling the cops and sex work "

Sex work is work — and because of the criminalisation of it, it can be dangerous work, without the legal protections that other workers can rely on. The police represent a significant threat to sex workers — both to their safety and their jobs. Reports show that police prioritse prosecuting sex workers over safeguarding them even in incidents of violence and abuse. Police conduct violent interventions like brothel raids and raids disguised as welfare checks. The police regularly target and threaten the lives and safety of sex workers. 

**We strongly support full decriminalisation of sex work and oppose all versions of the Nordic Model. For more information about the rights and campaigns of sex workers check out <https://www.swarmcollective.org/>, <https://decrimnow.org.uk/> and <https://prostitutescollective.net/>**
