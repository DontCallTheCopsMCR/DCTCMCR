title: "What is intersectionality? "
---
To get liberated from oppression, we must see the systems and structures that uphold it and understand our own place inside them. 

 

Sisters Uncut’s approach to organising towards that liberation is rooted in intersectionality. It is central in all our work but you can find a simple summary in our safer spaces policy:

 

“*We experience different kinds of oppression and violence at the same time, including racism, disableism, poverty, transphobia, transmisogyny, homophobia, islamophobia and antisemitism, as well as others. These oppressions are not separate from each other which can be exhausting & painful. We want to create a community that recognises and challenges the oppression & exploitation that some of us are harmed by and some of us benefit from.*”
