title: "Calling the cops and crime "

There are a lot of complex reasons why crime occurs - but structural inequality plays a significant role. Everyone deserves to have the harm they experience taken seriously - whether this is the survivors of crime or people who engage in offending behaviour.

The criminal justice system does not prevent or reduce harm - instead, it exacerbates it. 

Often, when you call the police, this can set off a chain of events which you did not anticipate, and over which you have no control. For example, Black people are more likely to experience a brutal use of force by the police. When you call the police, there is a significant risk that more people will be harmed, or that the harm caused will be greater - the police will often fail to deescalate a situation, putting people at risk. People may have experienced discriminatory policing practices and feel particularly threatened by the police.

We should also be mindful of our own prejudices. What we consider “suspicious” may be affected by our biases around race, class and other factors. Everyone has prejudices, and these prejudices can affect how we act - especially when the media propagates these stereotypes.
