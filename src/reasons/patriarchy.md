title: "What’s transformative justice? "
---
Transformative Justice is a name for an alternative to our current justice system. The current system involves the police, courts, the state and carceral punishment (and other forms of punishment).

 

Instead of punishment, transformative justice systems seek to respond to violence without creating more violence and engage in harm reduction. 

 

Marginalised people are already at greater risk of harm in our traditional justice system. Transformative justice looks for alternatives. It looks for ways that allow communities to heal from incidences of harm and violence - for example, by bringing together the people and communities that have caused and experienced harm so they can heal together.
