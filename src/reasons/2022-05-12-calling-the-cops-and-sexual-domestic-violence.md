title: Calling the cops and sexual & domestic violence
---
When it comes to violence happening right in front of us, the police are the only rapid-response resource we’ve been given by the state. Sometimes it will be necessary to call the police if someone is being attacked right now and you have no other way of intervening which keeps you safe. 

But there are lots of problems with this.

First, the police are inept and unable to respond appropriately to gendered violence. Between June 2019 and June 2020, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) failed to record 80,000 crimes (1). Of the incidents of domestic abuse which were recorded, the proposal highlights that only 1 in 13 were prosecuted (2).

Further, the experiences of survivors who seek criminal justice are overwhelmingly negative. Survivors often report feeling “revictimised” by the process, making their recovery harder or impossible. Even if someone gets prosecuted for perpetrating the abuse (and they regularly do not due to discriminatory decision making by the state, or survivors feeling they must withdraw support for a prosecution because they are not prepared to subject themselves to such a traumatising process), the criminal justice  process does very little to change the perpetrator’s views and behaviours or help the survivor.

The police are also perpetrators who are unable to police themselves. Across the UK police, employees accused of domestic abuse are a third less likely to be convicted than are the general public (3). GMP delivered one conviction from 79 reports of domestic violence against their personnel in a 3 year period (4). Police officers and staff across the UK were reported for domestic abuse almost 700 times in the three years up to April 2018 - more than four times a week on average - and the number is likely to be higher given some police forces have not responded to requests for this information (5).

Finally GMP are a hotbed of prejudice and work closely with the Home Office, the government department responsible for policies around crime and immigration. Police intervention can have dangerous consequences if, for example, anyone involved is a person of colour, a sex worker, or someone with uncertain immigration status.

For these reasons we should consider all the other options before calling the police. We need to be prepared to signpost the individual who has been attacked to local, expert resources which will support them. We need to be aware of resources which can help perpetrators change their behaviours. We need to challenge the idea in our communities that locking men up will solve the problem. 

Finally, we need to put pressure on local and national government to give proper funding to services for both survivors and perpetrators. Funding for refuges has been cut by ¼ since 2010 (6).
