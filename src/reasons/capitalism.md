title: "What is abolition? "
---
Abolitionists believe that putting people in prison (sometimes called "carceral punishment") is bad for society and actually harms the people the police claim to protect. They believe that justice isn't something that comes from the state (i.e. the police, the criminal justice system and the politicians that make decisions about how these things are run). 

 

Instead, the community can solve its own problems by investing in mutual aid, transformative justice and harm reduction. 

 

We often hear about ‘defunding the police’, but what does this look like in practice? A practical example of how we could do this is take money away from the police (for example, money to be used for oppressive surveillance technologies) and instead use it for mental health services in school, which will ultimately reduce harm in society without relying on the concept of carceral punishment. As a society, we could choose to prioritise funding care over state-sanctioned brutality. There is a sorry history of police brutality in the UK, and violence is embedded in policing culture. For example, the Metropolitan Police is four times as likely to use force against Black people.(1)
