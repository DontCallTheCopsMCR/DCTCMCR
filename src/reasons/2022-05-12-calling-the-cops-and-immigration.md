title: "Calling the cops and immigration "
---
For many migrants, the stress of interacting with police is compounded by the threat of immigration enforcement and even deportation. It is widely known that the police share data with the Home Office and often make decisions that put immigration enforcement ahead of safeguarding. Because of this, many migrants avoid unnecessary interactions with the state, including the police.

Calling the police in a situation where a person has insecure immigration status could be devastating. Until we have a protective firewall between the police and immigration enforcement, interacting with the police will never be safe for migrants with insecure status.

The movements for police and border abolition exist hand in hand. Both demand freedom from state-inflicted oppression. Borders don’t exist for everyone. People with power and privilege move freely around the world everyday. What border abolition demands is that this freedom be open to everyone.
